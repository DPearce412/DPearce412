### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

D.Pearce here. I'm currently working on becoming a professional software developer. Recent TechElevator bootcamp graduate, and now I'm working on my own projects to keep my skills honed. Working on my text-based adventure game that leans into my strengths as a writer of weird fiction. Simultaneously building a website for my own underground metal cassette tape label, the Vile Reliquary.
