### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

D.Pearce here. I'm currently working on becoming a professional software developer. Coming in as a recent TechElevator bootcamp graduate; now I'm working on more solo projects to keep my skills honed. That means: ever-refining and adding on to my text-based adventure game, which leans into my strengths as a writer of weird fiction. And simultaneously building a website for my own underground metal cassette tape label, the Vile Reliquary.
